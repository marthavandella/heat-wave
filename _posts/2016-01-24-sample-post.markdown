Instructions

How to make a post for a jekyll blog using markdown:

1) Create a copy of this file and give it a name with form `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.markdown`
2) Change 'title:  "Welcome to Jekyll!"' to the title you want for your post. Ensure the title is enclosed by speech marks.
3) Change 'date:' to the date of publication. Hours, minutes and seconds are not important.
4) Replace these instructions with your blog posts content.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
