Anti-KKK Coordinating Meeting<br />
Sunday, April 10 @ 5pm<br />
<a Href="http://murmurmedia.org/">Murmur DIY Space</a><br />
100 Broad St, Downtown Atlanta<br />
</p>
<p>
On Sunday, April 10, please join us at Murmur for a meeting to coordinate anti-racist action on April 23 at Stone Mountain Park. The anti-racist mobilization has been called in response to a white supremacist rally planned for the same day.
</p>
<p>
Over the past few months, All Out Atlanta has been in contact with a wide variety of groups, including black community groups, activist organizations, sports clubs and motivated individuals (to name a few!). At this point, we're aware that many groups have plans, ideas, and desires for April 23rd. We hope everyone can get together on the 10th to outline plans against the white power rally and to coordinate diverse and effective responses. Hope to see you there!
