<p>
It’s now one week until April 23rd, when we will confront and shut down the Klan/neo-Nazi rally at Stone Mountain Park outside Atlanta GA!<br>
 
We’ve been coordinating with a broad coalition to make the anti-racist event on the 23rd a success. Below are some key updates:<p>

<ul class="nav">
    <li>
    <h3>GATHERING SPOT ANNOUNCED</h3><p>On Saturday, April 23rd, anti-racists are assembling at 9AM at the corner of Main & Mountain St. in the city of Stone Mountain. Please arrive a bit early, as parking is limited and it may take some time to find space nearby.<br>
	<p>We have created a new outreach poster that shows the assembly point. A .pdf to print and distribute is here: https://alloutatl.com/img/noklanposter.pdf  Please make copies and spread these everywhere! An image to circulate online is at: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CgG7SaZUMAA-pWU.jpg </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h3>CONVERGENCE SPACE</h3><p>We will use our convergence space, located at No Man’s Land, 880 Woodrow St SW in Atlanta, to host workshops, discussions, and other events to prepare for the April 23rd action. Food will be provided and space for camping is available. The convergence space will be open all day on Thursday and Friday the 21st and 22nd--we encourage you to visit and spend time at the space as we prepare for Saturday the 23rd.<br>
 	Our convergence space is at No Man’s Land, 880 Woodrow St SW in Atlanta. Google Maps: https://www.google.com/maps/place/880+Woodrow+St+SW,+Atlanta,+GA+30310/<br>
 	A complete schedule of events at the convergence space will be announced soon, so please check the AllOutATL website, Twitter, and/or Facebook account regularly for details.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h3>LEGAL FUND</h3><p> We are also proactively raising funds to bail any anti-racist protesters who may be arrested in connection with the mobilization against the KKK/neo-Nazis at Stone Mountain. Consider making a donation at: https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/legal-support-for-anti-kkk-protesters<br>
 	If any funds are left over in this fund after the April 23rd mobilization, they will be put towards legal support for protesters in Atlanta going forward.</p>

	<h3>SUGGESTED READING</h3><p>If you have time for extra reading, we encourage you to look at this news article about the “Rock Stone Mountain” racist rally and its coordination with neo-Nazis who are protesting in Rome, Georgia on the same day: http://www.northwestgeorgianews.com/rome/news/local/rome-white-rights-rally-timed-with-stone-mountain-event/article_5abd0d10-0132-11e6-a684-239cf726ce16.html<br>
 
	Since we do not expect the white supremacists rallying at Stone Mountain to arrive in Klan robes, we also encourage you to read this article on recognizing white power symbols: http://makingnoiseinthesouth.com/index.php/2015/11/07/from-antifa-atlanta-far-right-threat-on-gsu-campus-in-atlanta/</p>

	 <h3>PROMO VIDEO</h3><p>Finally, we love the promotional video that was created for our mobilization. If you haven’t already seen it, check https://vimeo.com/162557418 and share with your friends.<p>

	<p>We look forward to seeing you soon!</p>
